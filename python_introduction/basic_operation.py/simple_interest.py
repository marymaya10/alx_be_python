# Step 1: Define variables
principal = 1000   # initial investment in dollars
rate = 0.05        # annual interest rate as a decimal
time = 3           # time in years

# Step 2: Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
